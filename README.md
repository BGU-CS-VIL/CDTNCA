### libcpab
licpab [2] is a python package supporting the CPAB transformations [1] in Numpy, Tensorflow and Pytorch.
Our code uses a modified version of libcpab which allows for circular warps.

## Author of this software 
Ilya Kafuman (email: ilyakau@post.bgu.ac.il)

## Requirements
- Standard Python(>=3.6) packages: numpy, matplotlib, tqdm
- PyTorch >= 1.4
- For Nvidia GPU iimplementation: CUDA==11.0 + appropriate cuDNN as well. You can follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Usage
Alignment of shapes generated from the 2D Shape Structure dataset [3]

```
python alignment.py [args]
```
* tess_size: list, with the number of cells in each dimension
* zero_boundary: bool, determines if the velocity at the boundary is zero 
* circularity: bool, allows for circular warps
